# Project 2: Employee and Department Database

**Goal:** Design a relational database to manage employee and department information and perform data analysis through SQL queries.

# Objectives
- Create normalized tables for employees, departments, and job roles  
- Enforce primary key and foreign key constraints  
- Query data to identify department size, average salaries, and job distribution  


# Skills used
- `CREATE TABLE` statements with constraints  
- Data insertion and updates (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`)  
- Querying with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions  
- Database normalization and relationship design  

# Example Query
```sql
-- Find the average salary per department --
SELECT d.department_name,AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d 
  ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
