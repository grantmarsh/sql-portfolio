# 1. Customer Analysis
**Description:**
This section examines customer spending patterns and engagement using the dvdrental dataset. Key metrics include total revenue, top customers, and average rentals.
**Insights from SQL Analysis:**
- Total revenue: $61,212.04
- Total number of customers: 599
- Top 10 customers contribution: $1,844.16 (~3% of total revenue)
- Average rentals per customer: 26.78

**Interpretation:**
The top 10 customers contribute only 3% of total revenue, indicating there arenâ€™t any heavy spenders dominating sales.
